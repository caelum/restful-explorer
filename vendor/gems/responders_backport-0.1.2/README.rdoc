== Responders Backport for Rails 2.3.x

Loving Rails 3 Responders[1] feature? Me too.

Wants to use Responders in your Rails 2.3.x apps? Use InheritedResources. IR backports [2] Responder to your Rails 2.3.x apps and adds lots of useful and awesome features.

However, in some cases we don't want to use all IR awesome features. So, I extracted Responders-backporting-stuff to a minimal lib. This is mainly to be use as a dependency by Restfulie (http://github.com/caelum/restfulie)


=== Notes

[1] Please see these posts about Responders :

http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2009/12/one-in-three-inherited-resources-has-scope-and-responders/

http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2009/08/inherited-resources-is-scopes-and-responder-fluent/


[2] This is not entirely true, since Rails 3 Responders was actually *inspired* by InheritedResources new features to Rails 2.
